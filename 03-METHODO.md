### Rare analysis

Rare SNPs have been analysed with the method MiST. [Sun J, Zheng Y, Hsu L. A Unified Mixed-Effects Model for Rare-Variant Association in Sequencing Studies. Genetic Epidemiology. may 2013].

All variants are analysed as a single cluster (at the transcript scale for all gene) without subcluster based on mutation's type. This method provides a score π which represents the mean effect of the cluster and a score τ which represents the heterogeneous effect of the cluster. The overall p-value tests the association between the set of SNPs and the trait of interest.

### Common analysis

Common SNPs have been analysed, locus by locus, using standard logistic regression.

This method provides a parameter Beta which represents the effect of the SNP on the analysed phenotype. The p-value tests the association between the SNP and the trait of interest.
